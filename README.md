# SFML Game Engine
An 2D game engine I made using SFML for personal purposes.
# Features:
- An example state
- A simple game loop
- A State manager
- An Asset manager that works with:
  - Textures
  - Fonts
  - .txt files
- A text manage
- 2D Collision detection (showcased in the example state)
- An FPS counter, which you can turn on or off using the config file.
- Some basic math and input methods.
